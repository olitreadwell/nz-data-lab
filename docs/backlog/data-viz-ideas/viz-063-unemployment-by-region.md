# viz-063 Unemployment by region

Self-contained spec for the `[viz-063] Unemployment by region` data-viz-idea issue. Implement the microsite from this doc alone; the master list is `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas.md` and the ranking is `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas-smoke-ranked.md`.

## Spec

- **Chart**: map (choropleth)
- **Source**: Stats NZ labour market (https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/labour-market/)
- **Story**: Unemployment is highest in the east coast regions and lowest in the main cities.
- **Interaction**: hover; year slider.
- **Critique**: strength is the regional divide; risk is that small regions have wide confidence intervals.

## Priority and smoke-test readiness

- **Priority**: priority-medium (Tier 3 of 6)
- **Smoke-test score**: see `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas-smoke-ranked.md`
