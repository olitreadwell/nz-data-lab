# viz-051 Government spending by department

Self-contained spec for the `[viz-051] Government spending by department` data-viz-idea issue. Implement the microsite from this doc alone; the master list is `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas.md` and the ranking is `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas-smoke-ranked.md`.

## Spec

- **Chart**: treemap
- **Source**: Treasury (https://www.treasury.govt.nz/)
- **Story**: Health, education, and social security are the three giant blocks of government spending.
- **Interaction**: drill-down by department; hover.
- **Critique**: strength is the budget scale; risk is that department names change, so use the current year.

## Priority and smoke-test readiness

- **Priority**: priority-low (Tier 5 of 6)
- **Smoke-test score**: see `docs/backlog/data-viz-ideas-smoke-ranked.md`

- Oli-style copy: no em dashes, no puffery, real verified numbers, named sources; every reference URL returns 200.
- Unit test per new component; `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx vitest run` pass in `apps/web`.
